rebar_autotdd_plugin
=====

A rebar3 plugin for auto running compile on source file change reloading modules in the shell.

Prerequisite
-----
On Linux you need to install inotify-tools.


Use
---

Add the plugin only to your user local rebar config in `~/.config/rebar3/rebar.config`:

    {plugins, [rebar3_auto]}.

If you add it to your project rebar.config, it will get unloaded each time compilation occurs, thus breaking it.

Then run
```
    $ rebar3 compile
```

Then just call your plugin directly in an existing application:


```
(relx) $ rebar3 auto
